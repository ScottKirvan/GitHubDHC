# GitHubDHC

An Obsidian theme that's an attempt to *clone* the current (2023) **GitHub's "Dark high contrast"** theme.

Some system settings you'll want to change:

font:  set this to one of the following:
`-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI","Noto Sans",Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,"Apple Color Emoji","Segoe UI Emoji"`
I used `Segoe UI`

Font size: 14

Under Appearance, turn off `Show inline title`
